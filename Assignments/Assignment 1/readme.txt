CSC305 Assignment 1
Jordan Cowan, V00958142

Requirements:
 - You have to use real-time to synchronize your animations. (2 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Space jelly tentacle modelling: The body has two scaled spheres, and each tentacle has 5 ellipses (also scaled spheres). (4 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Space jelly tentacle animation (moving wave) (4 Marks). [COMPLETE, looks slightly different than the example]
 - Space jelly tentacle positioning (3 tentacles) (3 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Space jelly animation: The Space jelly must float in a circle around the character. It should always be aligned with the tangent of the circle. (4 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Astronaut modelling: Helmet with visor, two arms (just a single segment each), two legs (upper leg, lower leg, and feet), NASA patch and the various inlets/outlets (6 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Astronaut body animation: The character should move (oscillate) in both the x and y world directions. (2 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Astronaut leg and arm animation: The legs of the character should kick (both hips and knees rotate) as shown in the video. Note that the feet do not move. The arms should also rotate. (6 Marks). [COMPLETE, looks slightly different than the example]
 - The stars should be randomly seeded behind the foreground objects and move offscreen. You should generate a set of spheres with random uniform scalings. When these move offscreen you should reset their locations offscreen. In this way the number of star objects remains static (they are reused after they fly off-screen) (4 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - You do not have to match the exact motion or dimensions of the objects shown in the examples. However, your scene should fit in the window (see 14) and be qualitatively and visually similar to the sample (4 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - Programming style (comments, functions) (2 Marks). [COMPLETE]
 - The scene should be 512x512. (-2 Marks if it is not). [COMPLETE]
 - You have to submit a SINGLE file called <firstname-lastname>.zip that includes all the necessary files. (-2 Marks if you do not).  [COMPLETE]
 - You have to include a readme.txt file that describes in full detail which of the required elements you have implemented successfully and which ones you have not. (-4 Marks if you do not). [COMPLETE]
